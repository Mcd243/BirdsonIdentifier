        <p class="intro">We are going to use a memory technique to associate the bird name with the bird song. 
            First think of a word that sounds like or that you associate with the bird name and enter that into the text box. 
            Second, play the birdsong by clicking on the image of the bird. Now, try to imagine what the bird is saying and enter that into the text box. 
            Now, think of a word that combines the first two words or phrases and enter it into the text box. This word is the key to remembering both the birds name and its song.
            Repeat the process for all the birds in the list.</p>
